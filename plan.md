# Private Schools Web Development Lead Generation Project

**Location:** Dar es Salaam, Tanzania  
**Target:** Private English-medium pre-primary & primary schools without websites  
**Objective:** Obtain verified contact information for web development service outreach

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This project focuses on identifying and acquiring contact information for private schools in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania that lack a professional web presence. These schools represent high-value prospects for web development services, as they typically:

- Serve growing middle-class families who expect online visibility
- Lack technical resources to build their own websites
- Are underserved by local web development agencies
- Operate primarily through word-of-mouth and physical marketing

The goal is to compile a verified contact database of **50+ schools** with complete contact information (phone, email, location) ready for outbound outreach campaigns.

## 2. Target Market Analysis

### Why Schools Without Websites Are Ideal Prospects

| Factor | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Growing Demand** | Parents increasingly search for schools online; schools without websites miss this visibility |
| **Low Competition** | Fewer agencies target this specific market segment |
| **Clear Value Proposition** | A website demonstrates professionalism and attracts more students |
| **Budget Availability** | Private schools charge tuition and have budget for essential services |
| **Repeat Business** | Schools need updates, online payments, student portals over time |

### Target School Profile

- **Type:** Private English-medium nursery/pre-primary & primary schools
- **Location:** Dar es Salaam (Ilala, Kinondoni, Temeke, Ubungo districts)
- **Size:** 50–500 students
- **Current State:** No active website or outdated online presence
